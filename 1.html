  <strong><h2>Universe</h2></strong>
  <p>The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time[a] and their contents,
    [10] including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.
    <br>While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3]
     it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe,
     <br>which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter.
     <br>In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally disconnected[11]
     constituent parts of a larger multiverse, <br>which itself comprises all of space and
     time and its contents.[12]</p>
