  <strong><h2>Landscape</h2></strong>
  <p>A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms, and how they integrate with natural or man-made features.[1]
  <br> A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as (ice-capped) mountains, hills, water bodies
  <br>such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation,
  <br>human elements including different forms of land use, buildings, and structures, and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions.
  <br> Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia,
  <br>landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity.</p>
