<p>In digital imaging, a pixel, pel,[1] or picture element[2] is a physical point in a raster image, or the smallest addressable element in an all points addressable display device; so it is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen.
<br>Each pixel is a sample of an original image; more samples typically provide more accurate representations of the original.
<br> The intensity of each pixel is variable. In color imaging systems, a color is typically represented by three or four component intensities
<br>such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
<br>In some contexts (such as descriptions of camera sensors), pixel refers to a single scalar element of a multi-component representation
<br>(called a photosite in the camera sensor context, although sensel is sometimes used),[3] while in yet other contexts it may refer to the set of
<br>component intensities for a spatial position. </p>
